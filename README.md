# Analysis and Prediction of Population Distribution Based on Linear Regression Model.

This project involves analyzing a dataset of global population distribution from 1950 to 2021, utilizing a linear regression model for predictive insights. The dataset contains various numeric fields, and the analysis includes calculating essential statistical measures such as minimum, maximum, mean, standard deviation, and quantiles for the cleaned data. The project also involves checking for inconsistencies between 'MidPeriod' and 'Time' fields to ensure data integrity. By focusing on numeric data and handling missing values attentively, this analysis provides a comprehensive overview of the population distribution trends over the years. The insights gained from the statistics and regression modeling can be instrumental in understanding historical changes and forecasting future demographic distributions.
